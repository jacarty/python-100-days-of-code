######################
# F-Layout & Z-Layout Patterns
######################

F-Layout Pattern
######################

What It Is
######################

Users scan content in an F-shaped pattern
Based on eye-tracking studies showing how people read web pages
Common on text-heavy pages (blogs, articles, search results)

The Pattern
######################

Horizontal movement across the top (header/navigation)
Second horizontal movement slightly down the page (subheading/intro)
Vertical movement down the left side, scanning for keywords

When to Use
######################

Content-heavy websites (news sites, blogs)
Search engine results pages
List-based content
Text-focused designs

Best Practices
######################

Place most important information in the top-left area
Use compelling headlines at the top
Left-align text and key elements
Front-load paragraphs with important keywords
Use bullet points and subheadings on the left
Place secondary content/ads on the right (less attention)

Structure
[====================] ← Top horizontal bar (logo, nav)
[==========]           ← Second horizontal scan
[===]
[===]                  ← Vertical scan down left
[===]
[==]

######################
# Z-Layout Pattern
######################

What It Is
######################

Users scan in a Z-shaped pattern
Eyes move horizontally across top, diagonally down, then horizontally across bottom
Common on simpler, less text-heavy pages

The Pattern
######################

Top-left to top-right (header, logo to navigation/CTA)
Diagonal down-left (scanning middle content)
Bottom-left to bottom-right (footer, final CTA)

When to Use
######################

Landing pages with minimal text
Simple homepages
Registration/signup pages
Promotional pages
Pages with clear conversion goals

Best Practices
######################

Place logo top-left
Put primary CTA or key navigation top-right
Guide eye with visual hierarchy along the Z-path
Place secondary CTA bottom-right
Use visual elements (images, arrows) to reinforce the Z-flow
Keep content minimal and scannable

Structure
[Logo ============= CTA] ← Horizontal top
       \
         \                ← Diagonal
           \
[Content    \    Image  ]
              \
[Info ========== CTA   ] ← Horizontal bottom

Key Differences
######################
F-Layou                     Z-Layout
Text-heavy content          Minimal content
Multiple sections           Few distinct sections
Blog posts, articles        Landing pages, promos
Slower, detailed reading    Quick scanning
Multiple focal points       2-3 main focal points

Combined Approach
Many modern websites use both patterns strategically:

Z-pattern for hero section/above fold
F-pattern for content sections below

Responsive designs may switch patterns based on screen size

Pro Tip: Don't force these patterns - use them as guidelines. Eye-tracking shows natural reading behavior, but good visual hierarchy and clear CTAs matter more than strict adherence to these layouts.
