In this lesson, we're going to be looking at movie budget and revenue data. This dataset is perfect for trying out some new tools like scikit-learn to run a linear regression and seaborn, a popular data visualisation library built on top of Matplotlib. 

The question we want to answer today is: Do higher film budgets lead to more revenue in the box office? In other words, should a movie studio spend more on a film to make more? 


Today you'll learn:

    How to use a popular data visualisation library called Seaborn

    How to run and interpret a linear regression with scikit-learn

    How to plot a regression a scatter plot to visualise relationships in the data

    How to add a third dimension to a scatter plot to create a bubble chart

    How to cleverly use floor division // to convert your data

Learning Points & Summary

Today was a pretty packed lesson where we introduced a lot of new concepts. In this lesson we looked at how to:

    Use nested loops to remove unwanted characters from multiple columns

    Filter Pandas DataFrames based on multiple conditions using both .loc[] and .query()

    Create bubble charts using the Seaborn Library

    Style Seaborn charts using the pre-built styles and by modifying Matplotlib parameters

    Use floor division (i.e., integer division) to convert years to decades

    Use Seaborn to superimpose a linear regressions over our data

    Make a judgement if our regression is good or bad based on how well the model fits our data and the r-squared metric

    Run regressions with scikit-learn and calculate the coefficients.
