**The Serpent's Code**

In digital gardens where logic blooms bright,
A serpent named Python slithers through night.
No fangs of syntax to pierce and to sting,
Just elegant verses that programmers sing.

Indentation sacred, whitespace divine,
Each block tells a story, line after line.
From lists comprehending to lambdas so clean,
The simplest of languages ever seen.

Django builds castles, Flask pours the wine,
NumPy counts stars while Pandas align.
Machine learning models predict and explore,
While beautiful soup scrapes the web's endless shore.

Beginner-friendly, yet powerful and vast,
From first "Hello World" to algorithms fast.
No semicolons needed, no brackets to match,
Just readable code in every batch.

Guido's creation, open and free,
A language that flows like poetry.
From scripts automation to AI's deep core,
Python slithers on, forevermore.

Community thriving, libraries grand,
Teaching millions across every land.
Version three onward, the future looks bright,
This serpent keeps coding through day and through night.
