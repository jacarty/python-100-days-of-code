"""
Objective Create your own decorator function to measure the amount of seconds that a function takes to execute. 

Expected Output:
    1695050908.1985211
    fast_function run speed: 0.33974480628967285s
    slow_function run speed: 2.9590742588043213s

Calculating Time   

time.time() will return the current time in seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00.

Try running the starting code to see the current time printed. 
If you run the code after a while, you'll see a new time printed.

e.g. first run:  1598524371.736911 
second run:  1598524436.357875 

The time difference = second run - first run  64.62096405029297  (approx 1 minute) 

Given the above information, complete the code exercise by printing out the time it takes to run the fast_function() vs the slow_function().

You will need to complete the speed_calc_decorator() function.
