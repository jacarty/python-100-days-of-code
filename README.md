# 100 Days of Python Course 🐍

This repository contains my code, projects, and learning progress as I work through the **100 Days of Code Complete Professional Python Course** by App Brewery. I'm taking this comprehensive course to continue my learning journey in application development and strengthen my Python programming skills.

Given my work commitments and other projects that I'm building, I expect it to take longer than 100 days to complete. I'm approaching this from a continuous learning mindset, focusing on consistent progress rather than speed, and applying the concepts to real-world scenarios as I advance through the curriculum.

## Course Overview

The course is structured into four main sections, progressively building from fundamental concepts to advanced professional development:

### 🌱 Beginner Python
- **Core Fundamentals**: Variables, data types, string manipulation
- **Control Flow**: Conditionals, loops, logical operators
- **Functions & Scope**: Creating reusable code and understanding variable scope
- **Data Structures**: Lists, dictionaries, and nested collections
- **Best Practices**: Code organization, debugging techniques, and documentation

### 🚀 Intermediate Python
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, and method implementation
- **File Operations**: Reading/writing files, working with CSV data
- **External Libraries**: Using modules like Pandas and Turtle graphics
- **Development Environment**: PyCharm setup and professional coding practices
- **Error Handling**: Exception management and robust code design

### 🌐 Intermediate+ Python
- **APIs & Web Services**: HTTP requests, authentication, and data exchange
- **Web Scraping & Automation**: Beautiful Soup, Selenium, and browser automation
- **GUI Development**: Desktop applications with Tkinter
- **Email & SMS**: Automated communication systems
- **Web Development**: Flask framework and templating with Jinja2

### 🎯 Advanced Python
- **Data Science Stack**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly
- **Database Management**: SQLite integration and data persistence
- **Statistical Analysis**: Regression analysis, hypothesis testing
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn for predictive modeling
- **Data Visualization**: Advanced charting and statistical plotting

## Professional Portfolio Projects

Throughout the course, I'll be building real-world applications including:

- 🎮 **Games**: Tic Tac Toe, Breakout, Space Invaders
- 🌐 **Web Applications**: Portfolio website, Todo list, Online shop
- 🤖 **Automation Tools**: Browser automation, social media bots
- 📊 **Data Analysis Projects**: Space race analysis, regression modeling
- 🛠️ **Utility Apps**: Text to Morse converter, Image watermarking tool

## Learning Goals

My primary objectives for this course are to:

1. **Strengthen Programming Fundamentals** - Build a solid foundation in Python syntax and best practices
2. **Master Application Development** - Learn to create both web and desktop applications
3. **Develop Data Skills** - Gain proficiency in data analysis and visualization
4. **Build a Professional Portfolio** - Create deployable projects that demonstrate real-world skills
5. **Understand Industry Practices** - Learn professional development workflows and tools
