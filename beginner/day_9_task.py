# ### Functionality
# - Each person writes their name and bid.
# - The program asks if there are others who need to bid. 
#   If so, then the computer clears the output (prints several blank lines) then loops back to asking name and bid.
# - Each person's name and bid are saved to a dictionary.
# - Once all participants have placed their bid, the program works out who has the highest bid and prints it.
