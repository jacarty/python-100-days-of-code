Day 13 Content - Debugging

The challenge will be a Number Guessing game.

Tips:
  - Describe the Problem
  - Reproduce the Bug
  - Play Computer
  - Fix the Errors
  - Use Print
  - Use a Debugger

Debugging FizzBuzz
- Read the code in exercise.py
- Spot the problems üêû. 
- Modify the code to fix the program. 
- No shortcuts

The code needs to print the solution to the FizzBuzz game.   
- Your program should print each number from 1 to x where x is the input number. 
- However when the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".   
- When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz". 
- And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz".
