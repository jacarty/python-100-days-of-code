Squaring Numbers

You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called squared_numbers. This new list should contain every number in the list numbers but each number should be squared. 

e.g. 4 * 4 = 16
4 squared equals 16.
**DO NOT** modify the List numbers directly. Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop. 

Target Output 
[1, 1, 4, 9, 25, 64, 169, 441, 1156, 3025]

Filtering Even Numbers

In this list comprehension exercise you will practice using list comprehension to filter out the even numbers from a series of numbers.   

First, use list comprehension to convert the list_of_strings to a list of integers called numbers.   
Then use list comprehension again to create a new list called result.
This new list should only contain the even numbers from the list numbers. 
Again, try to use Python's List Comprehension instead of a Loop.
